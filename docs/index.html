		<p>My name is Fissehatsiyon Abate. My friends call me Fisseha, as my full name is apparently excessively lengthy and somewhat difficult to pronounce, according to them. I was born in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. I grew up there until the age of 12 before coming to Australia in late 2014. I can fluently speak two of the eighty languages in Ethiopia. Those I speak are Amharic and Ge'ez. The first five years of my stay in Australia were in Adelaide, South Australia. I recently moved to Melbourne with my family after completing Highschool. I have so far enjoyed the couple of months that I have been here in Victoria. As most Ethiopians are, I am a big follower of Soccer. Although I do not do much playing these days, I passionately support Manchester United F.C. which is a club in England's top soccer league. I also do a lot of drawing and painting in my spare time which I at one-point thought was going to be the career I would pursue. Even though I have not done a lot of artwork, I still consider myself an artist. One rather interesting fact about myself is that I'm one of the 5% of the world's population who does not experience headaches.</p>

	  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
	  
	  <h2>Project Description</h2>
	  
	  <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Topic</h3>
      
      <p>The proposed smart home security solution is a system that integrates mobile applications with mechanical and graphical devices in order to ensure the safety of users’ houses. Implementation of this system involves putting in place a wide range of mechanical devices such as fingerprint scanners, face and voice recognition systems, video surveillance and others to transform the traditional ways of home safety management. In doing so, the system will eliminate the need for doors to have handles and users to carry around any physical keys, and rather utilise biometric authentications to deny or grant access to selected parts of the house. </p>
      
      <p>The aforementioned devices will all be governed by a smart hub located inside the users’ house which will be used in conjunction with the mobile app. The mobile app, that comes with the smart homes security system, will primarily be used to manage and interact with the whole security system. The app will enable users to register authorised individuals into the system, record data involving the identity of the authorised individuals, and set certain preferences to their likings. Through the app, authorised users will gain accesses such as access to 24/7 video surveillance cameras, voice messages, manual control of doors and much more. </p>
      
     <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>The development of this home security system was motivated by the group’s deep interest in developments of innovative systems that are readily applicable and assist in solving common problems in society. The importance of this project is undoubted as ensuring the safety of family, home and valuables is a priority for every individual and assisting in this task with the use of high complexity technologies is something that is this group's common interest.</p>
      
      <p> Assessing the components and applications of this system shows how well it fits with the current IT trend as the system comprises up-to-date and ultra-modern technologies such as face recognition. If the possibility of working on this project was to become real, it would show a great range of skills of a future employer, such as app development, cloud computing and project management and much more. </p>
      
      <h3> Landscape</h3>
      <p>There are numerous smart home security products that are available on the market. Even though they are all under the same category of ‘home security‘ there are differences when it comes to the way they operate and are installed. That being said, although there aren’t many products that encompass all features of the smart security system proposed, there are however various products that primarily focus on partial features of our smart security system such as smart door locks, smart video surveillance systems etc. The most popular home security products on the current market include Ring, Vivint
      SimpliSafe, ADT, Frontpoint etc.  </p>

	  <h3 name="plansAndProgress">Plans and Progress</h3>
	  <p> We have decided to continue with the same project idea in this assignment as well, since everyone in our team agreed that it was a good idea. However we have made some small changes and thought of more details to make it work and what tools will be necessary. We also came across dead-ends and some problems but luckily we managed to resolve.</p>
	  <p> Our project is a smart home security system. When at first a buyer purchases this security system a team from the company will arrive at the customers home in order to set it up and install it. The price of the product will be estimated around to 10.000$. The security system will contain 4 cameras. Another feature that will be provided is a new door with a device that will consist of a microphone with an integrated speaker, a small scanner under it that will allow the user to touch with his finger in order for his fingerprints to be recognised and a small camera making it possible for the people who are inside can see who is outside on the screen. Also the system will come with a screen that will be installed inside the house in order to allow the user to monitor the house through the cameras. If the user wants to change the screen and buy a bigger one for example he can replace it with one of his choice. The front door will also be replaced by the company with a door that will not have a keyhole or a handle to open it but it will only have the device in the middle with the microphone and speaker, the camera and the screen for the fingerprint. The main device that will control everything will be a cube that can hear commands by the members that are signed in the device. Additionally, the Smart Home Security System also helps to protect and manage electricity. This Smart Home Security System can be used to monitor your home's energy use. This is very important as we mostly leave homes and realized that we have left the lights on or some appliance running However through the Smart Home Security System gives you remote access, it allows you to shut off the appliances no matter where you are. It can also be used to shut down heating or cooling devices when no one is home to turn them back on just before you arrive. Finally the cameras, the main device and the device on the door will have an integrated battery where as in a power cut the system will no doubt continue to function.</p>
	  <p> The cameras will come in two colours and the buyer can choose between white and black. When the system is first bought it comes with the 4 cameras. The buyer will be able to decide where he wants to install each either outside or inside the house. If the user decides later on he will be needing more extra security for his house he can purchase them from the website and these will also be installed by the company with no extra charge. In order for the cameras to be accessed the user will have to say a specific phrase which is “Access cameras” and the screen will open showing all cameras. Then if the user wants to have only 1 camera on the screen he will need to say “Check camera 1” or any number he wants based on how many cameras the house has. By saying “All cameras” the screen will return to the previous feature showing all 4 cameras and if the user wants to turn the screen off he will have to say “Close cameras”. If a blackout occurs and there is no electricity the battery that the cameras have, will allow them to function for at least 10 hours recording all possible actions.</p>
